There're two types of scrapers for scraping LiHKG in our project
- scrape_id/scrape_postid.py: scrape the ID/url of posts to scrape under some keywords in search
- hkg.py: scrape a single post with specified post id
- scrape_pd.py: the function to scrape a post and format the content, time, number of support/against into a pd.DataFrame
